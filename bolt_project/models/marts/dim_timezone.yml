    description: >
      Static dimension mapping cities to their respective IANA time zone identifiers. 
      Used to convert local timestamps (departure and arrival times) 
      to UTC within the flight and trip models. 
      This model ensures consistent timezone handling for all cities in the dataset.

    columns:
      - name: city
        description: >
          City name as used in trip or flight tables. 
          Serves as the natural key for joining with origin and destination city fields.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: iana_tz
        description: >

          Examples include 'America/New_York', 'Europe/Paris', and 'Asia/Tokyo'. 
          Used in Snowflakeâ€™s `CONVERT_TIMEZONE` function for accurate UTC conversion.
        tests:
          - not_null
